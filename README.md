On February 22nd, 2014, I took part in a the Urban Data Challenge Hackathon in San Francisco.

This is the animation application I wrote during the hackathon. Other members of the team included Jesse Day, Eric Socolfsky, Karen Marcelo and Kristin Henry.

This is in Java with the Processing libraries, designed for use with the Eclipse IDE.

The animation proposes a two-monitor environment (this would be one of the monitors), where visitors could "see themselves" a the camera and a person icon with different colors indicating their emissions (particulate matter, CO, CO2, etc.)

They would also see animated images of buses, trucks, cars and other people superimposed onto live movement of these same vehicles. The colors bars on the images would indicate what type of emissions are present.

I haven't altered the source code since the hackathon, so it is incredibly rough. This is what you'd expect in a hackthon.
